The {#rmd-basics} text after the chapter declaration will allow us to link throughout the document back to the beginning of Chapter 1.

<!-- ## Descriptive Statistics -->
<!-- ![Descriptive Statistics](C:/Users/furka/desktop/images/descriptive.png){width=50%} -->

```{r include=TRUE, paged.print=TRUE}
print(summary(data[,1:41]))
```

to understand the structure of the dataset,we looked at the summary statistics of the variables.
Our observations are the 81 cities of Turkey.There are no missing value in the entire dataset.

We can see that some variables has high variances rather than other variables that is because there are metric differences between variables.these metric differences are considered at the next stages.


## *Multinormality Test*
```{r include=TRUE}
HZ.test(data)
```
*H0 : Data distributes multivariate normality*\
*H1 : Data does not distribute multivariate normality*\


To check if the data distribute multivariate normality the Henze-Zirkler multivarite normality test is used. p-value is ~= 0.02 . There is statistically enough evidence to reject H0 in 95% confidence level. Data does not distribute multivarite normality\

if every variable is tested one by one with shapiro wilk normality test\


```{r include=TRUE}
for(i in 1:ncol(data)) {
  if(shapiro.test(as.matrix(data[,i]))[2] > 0.05) {
    print(paste(i,". variable distributes normally",sep=""))
  }
}
```
the indexes of variables that ditributes normally are listed above.


## Correlation Matrix

```{r include=TRUE}
corrplot(cor(data))
```

at the correlation graph above, it is seen that there are highly correlated variables in the dataset.

\pagebreak

### List of Correlated Variables

```{r include=TRUE}
# indexes of correlated variables
cor_index <- which((cor(data)>0.7) | (cor(data)< -0.7),arr.ind = T) 

# correlation matrix is a symmetric matrix so repeated indexes are deleted
d_index <- c()
for(i in 1:103) {
  if (cor_index[i,1] == cor_index[i,2]) {
    d_index <- c(d_index,i)
  }
}
cor_index <- cor_index[-d_index,]

dd_index <- c()
for(i in 1:62) {
  if(i == 62) {
    break
  }
  for(x in ((i+1):62)) {
    if (all(c(cor_index[i,1],cor_index[i,2]) == c(cor_index[x,2],cor_index[x,1]))) {
      dd_index <- c(dd_index,x)
    }
  }
}


cor_index <- cor_index[-dd_index,]
rownames(cor_index) <- NULL
print(cor_index)
```
### Determinant of Correlation Matrix 

$$ |cor(data)| = 6.27e^{-23}$$ 
determinant of correlation matrix is calculated approximately 0.There is multicollinearity problem in the dataset.That information tells us dataset is proper for Principal Component Analyis.
